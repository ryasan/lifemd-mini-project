# Project Refinement Notes

## The Goal

To demonstrate how an improved design can keep users engaged.

## 1. Testimonial Page

### ✅ Completed Refinements

- Add staggered animation intro
- Consistent theme coloring with more uses of the green shading
- Add subtle shadow to card container for modern look
- Improved typography with letter-spacing and heavier font-weights for the "high-trust" pieces of content
- Improved layout spacing
- Updated marquee to loop perfectly (zero stutter)
- Add hover-to-pause interaction to give users more control
- Add soft gradient to the marquee for a more polished look
- Added semantic HTML, ARIA labels and roles, descriptive alt text for images

### 💡 Future Suggestions

- Move away from image sprite to code-based marquee using individual text and images, which is better for SEO/accessibility and ensures the text is always crisp regardless of container size
- Consider using an interactive carousel slider instead of a marquee to give users more control
- Add Visual progress bar or pagination dots on carousel
- Use `prefer-reduced-motion` to allow users to opt-out of non-essential animations
- Redesign desktop since it currently looks like mobile

## 2. Statistics Page

### ✅ Completed Refinements

- Touched up the teal overlay with some glassmorphism for a "premium clinical" feel
- Made the percentages much larger since they're the hook and remaining text, the explanation
- Polished existing staggered animation
- Updated the button to be pill shape (better for mobile) and enhanced hover state
- Give subtle float animation to checkmark icon so page isn't so bland when idle

### 💡 Future Suggestions

- Maybe use progressive carousel to keep user focused on one stat at a time rather than overwhelming them
