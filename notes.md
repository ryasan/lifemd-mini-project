# Notes

## Changes

- Add staggered animation intro
- Consistent theme coloring with more uses of the green shading
- Add subtle shadow to card container for modern look
- Improved typography with letter-spacing and heavier font-weights for the "high-trust" pieces of content
- Improved layout spacing
- Updated marquee to loop perfectly (zero stutter)
- Add hover-to-pause interaction to give users more control
- Add soft gradient to the marquee for a more polished look
- Added semantic HTML, ARIA labels and roles, descriptive alt text for images

## Suggestions

- Move away from image sprite to code-based marquee using individual text and images, which is better for SEO/accessibility and ensures the text is always crisp regardless of container size
- Consider using an interactive carousel slider instead of a marquee to give users more control
- Add Visual progress bar or pagination dots on carousel
- Use `prefer-reduced-motion` to allow users to opt-out of non-essential animations
- Redesign desktop since it currently looks like mobile
